# Collaborative-Diffusion-Path-Planning-Using-OpenCL-on-GPU

## Algorithms

This project represents implementing the path planning algorithm proposed in [1]. The algorithm is called Collaborative Diffusion, designed to be implemented on a GPU using parallel threads for grid maps.

The algorithm is summarized as follows.

The following example shows a map of size 64*64:

## Instructions:

The kernel program is 'matrixAverageFilter.cl'.

To modify the obstacle generation method, change the value of '#define obstacles_tpye 1' to '0', '1', or '2' in 'main.cpp'.

This project leverages [Boost Compute]([https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg](https://github.com/boostorg/compute)) for OpenCL applications. Being exclusively a template/header library, it bypasses the need for additional compilation or linkage. Boost included Compute starting from version 1.61.

### For Linux Users:

Should your system's repositories not have the latest Boost version, execute 'make boost' to download a current version directly into the project.

To build and initiate the program, simply run the 'make' command.

### Windows User Instructions:

AMD Graphics: Obtain the OpenCL SDK via [Github](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases). For Nvidia Graphics: Secure the CUDA Toolkit from [Nvidiaâ€™s website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

Proceed to download [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) and place it in a newly created subfolder named 'boost', excluding any version numbers.

Given Compute's dependency on libboost_chrono, building all libraries is recommended. In the Visual Studio command prompt, go to the boost folder and run 'bootstrap' and then 'b2' to complete this process.
